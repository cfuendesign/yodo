# yodo

Pronounced "You-do", yodo is a simple CLI tool to read and execute CRUD operations on YAML files representing todo lists.

### why

I just want to create a simple todo list that I can easily take a peek from the terminal to track my progress without having to leave Neovim. No internet, no apps, no smartphone, nothing. Just a command in my terminal.

### the name sucks

I know. It stands for "YAML todo". I had a better name but forgot what it stood for so I'm sticking to "yodo", which has a simple meaning and is written the same as iodine (the halogen) in spanish.

### roadmap

v1.0
- [ ] Read todos from file [Done in API]
- [ ] Add todo [Done in API]
- [ ] Mark todo as done [Done in API]

- [ ] Flush items marked as "done" [Done in API]
- [ ] Marking "done" items as "todo" (undo dones)
- [ ] Delete todos
- [ ] Delete items marked as done

v1.1
- [ ] TUI with normie bindings

v1.2
